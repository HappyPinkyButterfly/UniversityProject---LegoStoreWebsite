# 🧱 Lego Store – University Web Project (Python + SQL)

> Built as a university database project using **Python, SQL, BeautifulSoup**, and **Bottle** framework.

---

## 🛒 About the Project

This project simulates a functional **LEGO online store** with a fully connected backend database. Users can register, browse LEGO sets, apply advanced filters, place orders, and view their past purchases.

The application demonstrates a working prototype of an e-commerce system – built from scratch using Python and SQL – while exploring real-world database relationships and query logic.

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python** (Bottle framework)
- 🧠 **SQL** – 5 relational tables (ER diagram below)
- 🌐 **HTML/CSS** – basic frontend interface
- 🧼 **BeautifulSoup** – for parsing and manipulating content
- 📦 **pipenv / Pipfile** – environment & dependency management

---

## 🧩 Key Features

- 👤 **User registration and login**
- 🔍 **Advanced product filtering** (by theme, price, age, number of pieces)
- 🛒 **Shopping cart system**
- 📦 **Order tracking** – view all previous purchases
- 📊 **Database-backed filtering logic**
- 🔗 **Relational database design** (see diagram)

## 📚 What I Learned

> _"This was my first introduction to building real web apps with Python – it taught me how to connect logic, data, and user experience."_ 💡

- Structured a real relational database with joins and foreign keys
- Implemented filters and queries based on user selections
- Understood user flow from registration to purchase
- Learned the value of clean architecture (in hindsight 🙂)
- Gained appreciation for better frameworks and frontend tools

## ⚠️ Developer Note

This project was written early in my development journey, and the codebase reflects that.  
Still, it represents a real working web application built from scratch using Python.

If I were to rebuild it today, I would:

- ✅ Use a more modern web framework like **Flask** or **Django** – or even **Java Spring Boot** for a scalable backend architecture.
- ⚙️ Avoid scraping/BeautifulSoup for internal content and instead use proper API-based or MVC design.
- 🎨 Implement a clean, responsive UI with **React** or **Vue** and styling libraries like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind**.
- 🧩 Structure the code into separate modules (routes, services, data access).
- 🛢️ Use an ORM such as **SQLAlchemy** or **JPA/Hibernate** for safer and more maintainable database handling.
- ♻️ Optimize for performance, security, and long-term extensibility.
